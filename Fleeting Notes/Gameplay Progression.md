# Ch.11 Progression in PvE Games

## Curiosity -> Discovery Arc -> Player Knowledge

- There are two main types of discovery arcs :
	- Exploration of virtual spaces and advancing the narrative
- Progression through level transition is a special kind of reward. 
	- Because player is viscerally moving ahead. 
- A common model is to have relatively short levels at the start and have each successive level take slightly longer to finish than the previous one. 
	- This lets player feel interesting.
	- Player can tolerate longer stretches near the end of the game.
